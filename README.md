# markdownlint

> A Node.js style checker/lint tool for Markdown files.

## Install

```shell
npm install markdownlint --save-dev
```

## Overview

The [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language is
designed to be easy to read, write, and work with. The language has succeeded,
but its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many stylistic decisions
are left to the author, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs
don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided.

`markdownlint` is a [static analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis)
tool for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [io.js](https://iojs.org/) with a
library of rules to enforce standards and correctness for Markdown files. It
was inspired by - and heavily influenced by - Mark Harrison's [markdownlint
for Ruby](https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint): the rules, rule
documentation, and tests for `markdownlint` come directly from that project.

> Aside: If you need a Ruby implementation or CLI, please consider
> [mdl](https://rubygems.org/gems/mdl). If you work with both platforms, most
> of what you know can be applied directly.
